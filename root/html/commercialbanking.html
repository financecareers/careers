                <p>Commercial banking refers to the financial services provided by banks to businesses. These services
                    include checking and savings accounts, loans, and credit facilities, among others. Commercial banks
                    provide a range of financial products and services to some individuals, but their primary focus is
                    on serving the needs of businesses of all sizes.
                    <br><br>
                    Commercial banks provide a source of capital for businesses to invest and grow. They also help
                    businesses manage their risk level by providing financial products and services that allow companies
                    to hedge financial risk. Commercial banks also play a key role in facilitating trade by providing
                    letters of credit and other services that help businesses secure payment from their customers.
                    <br><br>
                    To become a commercial banker, it is typically necessary to have a bachelor's degree, and some banks
                    may prefer applicants with a degree in a business-related field such as finance or economics. Many
                    banks also require candidates to pass certain exams, such as the Series 6 or Series 7 exams, which
                    test knowledge of financial products and regulations.
                    <br><br>
                    Commercial bankers typically earn an average salary relative to other careers in the finance
                    industry. They often start their careers in a more operational role, such as a teller or loan
                    processor. From there, they can work their way up to more senior roles, such as a loan officer or
                    branch manager. These roles typically involve more interaction with customers and require strong
                    communication and problem-solving skills.
                    <br><br>
                    As they progress in their career, they may have the opportunity to specialize in a particular area,
                    such as commercial lending or investment banking. They may also have the opportunity to take on more
                    strategic responsibilities, such as leading business development efforts or managing a team of
                    bankers. Some commercial bankers may eventually have the opportunity to become a senior executive or
                    board member at a bank.
