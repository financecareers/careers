                <p>Financial planning is a profession that helps individuals and families plan for their financial
                    futures. Financial planners will assess their clients' financial goals and help them develop a plan
                    to achieve those goals. They may advise clients on a wide range of financial decisions, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Setting financial goals: Financial planners work with their clients to identify their long-term
                        and
                        short-term financial goals.</li>
                    <li>Creating a budget: Financial planners help their clients create a budget to manage their income
                        and
                        expenses and stay on track towards reaching their financial goals.</li>
                    <li>Developing a saving and investing plan: Financial planners can help clients develop a plan for
                        saving and investing that aligns with their financial goals and risk tolerance.</li>
                    <li>Managing debt: Financial planners can help clients develop a plan to pay off their debts and
                        manage
                        their credit.</li>
                    <li>Planning for major life events: Financial planners can help clients navigate complex financial
                        situations, such as buying a home, getting married, or starting a family.</li>
                    <li>Managing retirement: Financial planners can help clients plan for retirement by assessing their
                        retirement needs, developing a retirement savings plan, and selecting the appropriate retirement
                        accounts.</li>
                    <li>Financial planners may also help their clients with tax planning, estate planning, and risk
                        management.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are several career paths that a financial planner can take. Here are some common options:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Starting a private practice: Many financial planners start their own private practice, offering
                        financial planning services to individual clients.</li>
                    <li>Working for a financial planning firm: Financial planners can work for a financial planning
                        firm,
                        where they may work with a team of financial planners and support staff to provide financial
                        planning services to clients.</li>
                    <li>Working for a bank or other financial institution: Financial planners can work for a bank or
                        other
                        financial institution, where they may provide financial planning services to the institution's
                        clients.</li>
                    <li>Working for a brokerage or investment firm: Financial planners can work for a brokerage or
                        investment firm, where they may help clients develop investment portfolios and provide other
                        financial planning services.</li>
                    <li>Working in a corporate setting: Financial planners can work in a corporate setting, where they
                        may
                        provide financial planning and analysis for the company or its employees.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Most financial planners hold a bachelor's degree in a related field, such as finance, economics, or
                business. Many also hold a certification, such as the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation,
                which requires a bachelorâ€™s degree and passing an exam. Financial planners often command a slightly
                below average salary when compared to other careers in the finance industry.
