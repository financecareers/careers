                <p>Investment bankers advise governments and corporations on how to effectively raise capital by issuing
                    securities and providing financial advice on mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Investment banks are
                    typically divided into two main areas: corporate finance and capital markets. The corporate finance
                    division helps companies raise capital and provides advice on M&A, while the capital markets sector
                    helps companies and governments issue securities and provides liquidity to the financial markets.
                    Investment bankers work with clients to identify their financial needs and develop strategies to
                    meet those needs, such as by underwriting and selling securities or assisting with M&A transactions.
                    Investment bankers also play a role in trading securities and providing liquidity to financial
                    markets. Investment bankers command a significantly above average salary relative to other careers
                    in the finance industry.</p>

                    Many students go into investment banking with the plan to exit after a couple of years. For those
                    that work up the ladder, the succession goes as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>Investment banking analyst: Investment banking analysts are entry-level positions that typically
                        last for two to three years. They work closely with senior bankers to provide financial analysis
                        and
                        support on a variety of transactions, including M&A deals and initial public offerings (IPOs).
                    </li>
                    <li>Investment banking associate: After completing the analyst program, many investment bankers
                        become
                        associates. Associates have more responsibility and work more independently than analysts, and
                        they
                        may lead smaller deals and work on more complex transactions.</li>
                    <li>Vice president: After several years as an associate, investment bankers may be promoted to vice
                        president (VP). VPs have significant responsibility and are typically in charge of leading deals
                        and
                        managing teams of analysts and associates.</li>
                    <li>Director: Directors are senior-level investment bankers who have significant responsibility and
                        are
                        typically in charge of managing teams of VPs and associates. They may also be involved in
                        business
                        development and client relationship management.</li>
                    <li>Managing director: Managing directors are the most senior level of investment bankers. They are
                        responsible for leading teams of directors and VPs and are often involved in setting the overall
                        strategy of the investment banking division.</li>
                </ol>

                    Investment bankers enjoy the most flexibility upon leaving. They often leave the industry to pursue
                    other career opportunities after several years of experience. Some common exit opportunities for
                    investment bankers include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Private equity: Private equity firms buy and sell companies, often with the goal of improving their
                operations and profitability. Investment bankers with M&A experience may be well-suited for careers
                in private equity.</li>
                    <li>Hedge funds: Hedge funds are investment vehicles that use a variety of strategies to generate
                returns for their investors. Investment bankers with a background in finance and investment may be
                interested in careers in hedge funds.</li>
                    <li>Management consulting: Management consulting firms advise companies on a variety of business and
                operational issues. Investment bankers with analytical skills and an interest in business strategy
                may be well-suited for careers in management consulting.</li>
                    <li>Corporate finance: Investment bankers with an interest in corporate finance may transition to roles
                in the finance departments of companies, where they can work on financial planning, budgeting, and
                other financial tasks.</li>
                    <li>Entrepreneurship: Investment bankers with an entrepreneurial spirit may choose to start their own
                businesses. Their financial skills and business acumen can be useful in starting and running a
                company.</li>
                    <li>Teaching and academia: Investment bankers with an interest in teaching and research may choose to
                pursue careers in academia.</li>
                    <li>Other financial services: Investment bankers may also transition to other financial services roles,
                such as wealth management or sales and trading.</li>
                </ul>
